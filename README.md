# SimpleCalculator
This is version 2 of my simple calculator. It has been completely redesigned from the first version.
The calculator can calculator factorials, powers and subtraction, addition, miultiplication and division.
You can either perform factorial or power with one number, or you can include it in an expression of two numbers which are being 
multiplied, divided, added or subtracted.
Eg:
1-5,
3/-2!,
-3*5^2,
3^2-4!,
2^2/2^3 etc.
